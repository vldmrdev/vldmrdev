- Main stack: Linux, Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Pytest, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0+, Pydantic 2.0+, Docker stack.
- Worked with: GitLab CI/CD, Github Actions, Kubernetes, Helm, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible.
- Side activities: contributing to open source, translates technical writing.
- Interesting fact: My path to software engineering was too long, previously I worked as a system administrator and devops engineer.
