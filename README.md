## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You are on a profile page whose author would be glad to cooperate, exchange experiences and knowledge with human :smiley:, drink coffee and write code.

- :battery: I'm open to work, part-time internships or volunteer projects.
- :seedling: I'm currently learning Python backend, FastAPI, Langchain and trying to make value in OSS projects.
- :memo: Interesting fact: My path to software engineering was too long, previously I worked as a system administrator and devops.
